# React

## build a react one page app

We will use the create-react-app package to create a react application.

```bash
create-react-app [name]-client-react
#to host the react project.
```

The package.json desribes the dependence relationship.  
Generally the react-app will be in localhost:3000.  
Everything under < /root> will be rendered dynamically injected __inmediatlly__.  
Everything will be finished in /src. index.js is the entry point from react point of view.  
Not all browers support ES6. like import. We will stick on the React.  
React.dom is speficing on the DOM.  Export the class the function and variables.  
React <-> React.DOM <-> Regular HTML.

React use the jsx, the intermix of js and html.  
```js
export default App;
//in the in end of the react.js
//then others can take the function App to render.
```

### deploy the react app to heroku [TODO]

### Node.js

Node.js is a framework to run js on a server.  
npm: node package manager. Equivilent to maven.  
For the node world, download the packages from npm repository.
