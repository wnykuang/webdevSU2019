# React

## TODO: build a react one page app

We will use the create-react-app package to create a react application.

```bash
create-react-app [name]-client-react
#to host the react project.
```

The package.json desribes the dependence relationship.  
Generally the react-app will be in localhost:3000.  
Everything will be rendered dynamically injected.  
Everything will be finished in /src. index.js is the entry point from react point of view.  
Not all browers support ES6. like import.  

## Node.js

Node.js is a framework to run js on a server.  
npm: node package manager. Equivilent to maven.  
For the node world, download the packages from npm repository.
